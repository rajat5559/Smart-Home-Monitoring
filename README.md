# Smart-Home-Monitoring-Using-ThingSpeak-IoT
To monitor different sensors data, we send sensors data to ThingSpeak cloud server using multiple ESP8266s (a low-cost Wi-Fi microchip with full TCP/IP stack and micro-controller capabilities) and sensors (Like Temperature and Humidity sensor, Light sensor, Vibration sensor, Pulse sensor etc). By this method we are monitoring different sensors data over internet using ThingSpeak IoT server, and can view the logged data and graph over time on the ThingSpeak dashboard. ThingSpeak is an open-source Internet of Things (IoT) application and API to store and retrieve data from things using the HTTP protocol over the internet or via a Local Area Network. ThingSpeak enables the creation of sensor logging applications, location tracking applications, and a social network of things with status update.

One of these ESP8266 acts as a local server and creates its hotspot. All the other ESP8266s connected to this hotspot in local network, read the data from sensors and send it to local server. This ESP8266 (local server) will collects the data from other ESP8266 and sends it to ThingSpeak server via wifi modem for live monitoring from anywhere in the world.
